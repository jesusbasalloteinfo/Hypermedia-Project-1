Curriculum Vitae of Jesús Basallote Gallardo

# User Persona
This is the User Persona that I've thought:

**Name:** Emma Thompson

**Demographic Profile:**
- **Age:** 28
- **Location:** United Kingdom
- **Profession:** Recruiter at a technology company
- **Education Level:** Bachelor's in Psychology and Master's in Human Resources
- **Professional Experience:** 4 years in recruitment and talent acquisition for technical roles

**Goals and Needs:**  
Emma is responsible for identifying candidates for technical positions. She needs to quickly assess if a profile has the required skills, experience, and educational background for a role. Emma values organization and clarity in resumes, as she has limited time to review each one.

**Frustrations:**
- Candidates who don’t highlight their skills clearly or present an unprofessional design.
- Disorganized information that forces her to spend more time than necessary finding key details.

**Preferences:**
- A clean, professional, and mobile-friendly design.
- Quick access to the candidate's contact information, relevant experience, and skills.
- Clearly structured sections for education, experience, skills, and contact information.

**Expectations:**  
Emma expects to find all relevant information concisely presented on a single page. She values a visually appealing design that conveys professionalism and attention to detail from the candidate.

# Project analysis, Information architecture
The information in the curriculum vitae has been organized with the aim of helping recruiters and hiring managers identify the most relevant aspects of the candidate's profile. By structuring the content into clear and concise sections, the goal is to highlight the education, work experience, and skills of the applicant. 

At the top, a header displays my name, title, and a brief personal statement describing in a sentence my personality, causing a good first impression to recruiters and hiring managers. 

Beneath the header, the page splits into two main columns. By separating content into distinct columns, the page encourages a natural left-to-right flow, showing the information in a way that highlights the most relevant details and guides the user through the CV. 

The left column contains my personal information, such as contact details, education, and languages. These sections help providing a quick overview for my background and credentials, formatted with bullet points and concise descriptions for easy understanding.

On the right column, the focus is on my professional experience and my learned skills. The experience section lists relevant work experience with a brief description of it. This is followed by the skills section, where technical skills are listed, giving recruiters an immediate knowledge of the candidate's skills. 

# Project analysis, Visual design
The visual design of this curriculum vitae prioritizes a professional, clean, and modern look to appeal to industry recruiters and hiring managers. A colour palette of shades of blue is used as the primary accent, with darker blues for headers and accent lines, representing reliability, intelligence and professionalism.

A neutral, light background is used to enhance readability without overwhelming the user. The main texts colour is dark grey for strong contrast and legibility, among the title texts, that are on blue like the colour palette.

The typography also reflects a modern and professional look, using as its main font, thanks to the clean and easy-to-read sans-serif font, Poppins. This choice contributes to the CV by modernizing its appearance, while remaining formal and professional. 

The two-column page layout that I’ve decided helps organizing the information into easier-to-read sections, providing a natural flow for recruiters who are quickly scanning through. Minimalist designs, such as those in the skills section, add visual interest and make important information stand out. 
Smooth animations, such as hover effects and transitions are important, as they enhance the overall design without being distracting. The subtle movements add a layer of interactivity that improves the user experience. Ultimately, these design elements contribute giving a good impression, showing the attention to detail and creativity.
